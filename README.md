# Oh My Zsh Setup Script

This repository contains a setup script to automate the installation and configuration of [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) on your system. The script can be run from a Bash shell and will configure Zsh as your default shell.

## Prerequisites

- A Linux-based system (or any system with Bash installed).
- Internet access (to download necessary packages and dependencies).
- `curl` or `wget` installed (to download the `Oh My Zsh` installer).
- Zsh must be installed on your system (the script checks and installs it if not present).

## Installation Instructions

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh
```
